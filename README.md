# Simple Federated Learning: Practical and Simple Notebooks

This repository provides a foundational exploration of Federated Learning (FL) concepts through clear explanations and practical examples. It aims to demystify FL by guiding you through its core principles and demonstrating its potential applications.

**Key Features:**

* **Beginner-Friendly:**  Starts with the basics, assuming no prior knowledge of Federated Learning.
* **Conceptual Focus:** Emphasizes understanding the "why" and "how" of FL, rather than complex implementations.
* **Illustrative Examples:**  Uses simple examples and analogies to make abstract concepts more concrete.
* **Manual Approach:**  Introduces key FL techniques through manual calculations and code, fostering deeper comprehension.

**Who is this for?**

* Students and professionals curious about Federated Learning.
* Developers looking to grasp the fundamentals of FL before diving into frameworks.
* Anyone interested in the potential of decentralized machine learning.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and install all the requirements
3. Work through the Jupyter notebooks to build your understanding of FL concepts.
4. Experiment with the provided code examples and modify them to explore different scenarios.
